Create a stealthy wired/wireless interface.
This script hides the computer, makes impossible to m.i.t.m and protects from scanning.

Basic idea:
- Change hostname
- Change mac address
- Disable ARP announce / ignore ARP
- Disable ICMP echo responses

Run it in it's own directory!

Build: g++ -o duppy duppy.cpp
Usage: ./duppy start/stop/check <interface>

The random mac address is generated by the network manager.

When start the script, it temporarily removes the known hosts.
At stop, removes the host(s) that used while duppy was active and sets back the originals.
This helps you to avoid the unwanted reconnect with your default mac.
The check option show the status of duppy, the actual mac and the actual hostname.

Dependency:
-network manager >= 1.4.0
-Linux kernel >= 2.6.4

Wrote and tested on Parrot OS 3.11
