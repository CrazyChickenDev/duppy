Create a stealthy wired/wireless interface.
This script hides the computer, makes impossible to m.i.t.m and protects from scanning.

Basic idea:
- Change hostname
- Change mac address
- Disable ARP announce / ignore ARP
- Disable ICMP echo responses

Usage: ./duppy start/stop <interface>
Run it in it's directory!

The random mac address is generated by the network manager.

When start the script, it temporarily removes the known hosts.
At the end, removes the host(s) that used while duppy was active and sets back the originals.
This helps you to avoid the unwanted reconnect with your default mac.

Dependency:
-network manager >= 1.4.0
-Linux kernel >= 2.6.4

Wrote and tested on Parrot OS 3.11
(Note: This script may cause to slow down the web surfing, but not affect the tools (in some cases, this speed up it!))

Build: g++ -Wall -o duppy duppy.cpp
