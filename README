Create a stealthy wired/wireless interface.

Basic idea:
- Change hostname
- Change mac address
- Disable ARP announce / ignore ARP
- Disable ICMP echo responses

Usage: ./duppy start/stop <interface>

The random generated by the network manager.
This script hide the computer, makes impossible to mitm and defend from port scanning.

When start the script, it temporarily removes the known hosts.
At the end, it set back and remove the used host(s) while duppy was active.
This helps you to avoid the unwanted reconnect with your default mac.

Dependency:
-network manager >= 1.4.0
-Linux kernel >= 2.6.4
